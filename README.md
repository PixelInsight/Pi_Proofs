# Pi Approximation Methods

This repository contains three different methods for approximating the mathematical constant π (pi). Each method demonstrates a unique approach to calculating this fundamental constant.

## Methods Overview

### 1. Statistical Approximation (Monte Carlo Method)

Uses random point generation within a square to estimate π through the ratio of points falling inside an inscribed circle.

### 2. Series Summation (Leibniz Formula)

Implements the Leibniz infinite series to approximate π through alternating series summation.

### 3. Geometric Approach (Archimedes' Method)

Approximates π using inscribed polygons, following Archimedes' classical approach.

## Requirements

- Any programming language
- Base language (no additional dependencies)
